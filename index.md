# Welcome!

I'm Mr. Zech and my aim is to help high school students **succeed in Mathematics**. 

# My Philosophy
* There's no such thing as a "math person." Every student is capable of learning maths given enough guidance and practice.
* Work at the student's individual pace - allowing students to take charge of their learning.
* Online tutoring - available anywhere in the world
* Exam practice

# What I Offer
* Private Tutoring
One on one tutoring is the most effective. I meet students in consistent weekly sessions lasting between 1.5 to 2 hours.

* Small Group Tutoring
"We're happy to tutor groups of friends! We can tutor 2+ people and even throw a study party for you and your friends if you're in the same class. If you've got an idea, or want to set up a group session for you and your friends - talk to us and we'll come up with something awesome!"
